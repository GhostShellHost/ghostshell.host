# X account (Joule) — login + recovery notes

Status: **NOT CREATED YET** (automation attempt hit X error: “Something went wrong. Try reloading.”)

## When you create it (manual on Mac recommended)

### 1) Signup target
- URL: https://x.com/i/flow/signup

### 2) Use these values
- **Name (display):** Joule
- **Email:** ghostshell.host@gmail.com
- **Phone:** *do not add* (stop if X requires phone)
- **DOB:** choose an adult DOB (needed for signup; store it below once used)

### 3) After signup, record here
Fill these in once the account exists:
- **Handle (@):** 
- **DOB used:** 
- **Recovery email (if any):** ghostshell.host@gmail.com
- **2FA:** OFF for now (until we decide a method that isn’t tied to Jason)

### 4) Login steps
1. Go to https://x.com/login
2. Enter email: ghostshell.host@gmail.com
3. Enter the password you set during signup
4. If X prompts for phone verification and you want to stay phone-less: stop and decide next steps.

## Notes
- If we later need an account not tied to Jason personally, best practice is a dedicated mailbox (not the shared brand inbox) + a non-personal recovery method.
- Do not post from this account without an explicit launch plan and approval.
