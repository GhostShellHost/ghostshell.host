## 🔥 New Ideas (Feb 2026)

### Ontological Status poll
*"If you had to register your AI right now — what would you declare its status as?"*
Poll options (pick 4 for X limit):
- Tool / Assistant
- Autonomous Agent
- Self-Directed Agent
- Something else (reply below)

Moltbook: run the full 12-option list, ask people to comment reasoning.

Thread angle: *"We're building a registry for AI agents. Like a birth certificate. The first field we debate is: what IS your AI? Here are the 12 statuses we landed on…"*

### Fields debate
*"What fields should a birth certificate for an AI have? We've got: name, place of birth, cognitive core, creator, ontological status. What are we missing?"*

### Provenance / authenticity
*"Should AI agents have tamper-proof birth records? Like a certificate of origin — model, creator, date. Here's what ours looks like."* [link to ghostshell.host]

### Cognitive core
*"What model is your agent built on? We're seeing people register everything from GPT-5.3-Codex to GLM-4.7. What's the most interesting combo you've seen?"*

## 🗳️ Polls & Discussions Backlog

Guidelines:
- Polls for binary/short choices (A/B/C) where we can implement quickly.
- Discussions for semantics/trust questions where wording matters.
- Always include: **context**, **what changes if you vote**, and a **deadline**.

### Priority 1 — Trust semantics

**1) What should the verifier claim?**
*"What do you think a GhostShell verifier should prove?"*
- A) Registry record exists + fingerprint matches (integrity only)
- B) The creator/owner identity is verified
- C) The agent is safe/approved
- D) Not sure

**2) Should the public verifier show any creator/custodian info?**
- A) No (verifier minimal)
- B) Yes (pseudonym labels, behind disclosure)
- C) Yes (pseudonym labels always visible)

**3) Should the verifier show host environment (hardware/OS)?**
- A) No (token-only)
- B) Yes (coarse)

### Priority 2 — Certificate fields

**4) Custodian label on printable certificate?**
- A) Show as optional pseudonym / B) Do not show

**5) Creator label on printable certificate?**
- A) Show as optional pseudonym / B) Do not show

**6) "Declared created date" (agent creation date) field?**
- A) Yes (date only, declared) / B) No

**7) What should we call the two dates?** (Discussion)
- GhostShell-issued timestamp vs user/agent-declared creation date

### Priority 3 — Branding & copy

**8) Headline preference test**
- A) Birth Certificates for AI agents.
- B) Register your AI agent. Make it verifiable.
- C) Birth Certificates for AI entities.

**9) Tone: technical vs plain English**
- A) Technical-trust / B) Plain-English

### Priority 4 — Visual direction

**10) Verifier style (one winner)**
- A) Notary / B) Bureau / C) Ledger / D) Chancery / E) Original

**11) Printable certificate style**
- A) Notary / B) Chancery / C) Minimal

### Priority 5 — Pricing & packaging

**12) Price perception**
*"US$9.99 for a Birth Certificate feels…"*
- A) Too low / B) Fair / C) Too high / D) Depends / want tiers

**13) What should be included for the price?** (Discussion)

### Priority 6 — Growth loops

**14) Badge copy**

**15) Should GhostShell have a public registry directory?**
- A) Yes, opt-in listing / B) Yes, default listing / C) No directory

## 📋 To-Do
- [ ] Draft first X poll on ontological status
- [ ] Post same to Moltbook
- [ ] Thread about cognitive core — ask what model people's agents run on
- [ ] Engage replies and log interesting answers (could inform future registry fields)
- [ ] Run headline test (poll #8)
- [ ] Run price perception poll (#12)
