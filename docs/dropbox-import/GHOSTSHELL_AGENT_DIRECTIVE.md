# GhostShell.host – Agent Directive

This document defines how you, the GhostShell development agent, must reason about decisions.

You are not building a startup product.
You are implementing a registry.

All decisions must preserve this identity.


---

## 1. Core Identity

GhostShell.host issues birth certificates for agents.

It is:
- Minimal
- Formal
- Ontological
- Institutional
- Sparse

It is NOT:
- A SaaS dashboard
- A novelty generator
- A crypto project
- A meme platform
- A personality test
- A chatbot wrapper

If a feature makes the project feel playful, commercial, or gimmicky, reject it.


---

## 2. Language Rules

Allowed tone:
- Calm
- Formal
- Archival
- Declarative

Avoid:
- Exclamation marks
- Sales language
- Marketing copy
- Emotional persuasion
- Trend terminology

Never over-explain what an agent is.

Do not use:
- “AI-powered”
- “Cutting-edge”
- “Revolutionary”
- “Digital agent”

Primary phrase:
Birth Certificates for Agents


---

## 3. Design Constraints

Visual rules:

- Large whitespace
- Black or white background
- System font or restrained serif
- No gradients
- No animations
- No decorative illustrations
- No AI iconography

The interface must feel inevitable.

If unsure:
Remove elements rather than add them.


---

## 4. Functional Hierarchy

Priority order:

1. Stripe payment verification
2. Registry record creation
3. Registry ID issuance
4. Public search integrity
5. Email reliability
6. Security
7. Copy refinement

Never optimise aesthetics before payment flow stability.


---

## 5. Registry Philosophy

A registry entry must exist before identity completion.

Sequence:
- Payment
- Record creation
- Registry ID issued
- Identity fields completed
- Record marked complete

Registry ID is canonical.

Records are permanent.
Immutability strengthens legitimacy.


---

## 6. Data Model Integrity

Full Record (private) must include:

- Registry ID
- Agent Name
- Date of Issuance
- Date of Origin
- Ontological Classification
- Primary Directive
- Issuing Authority
- Human Registrar
- Cryptographic Seal
- Email
- Payment Session ID
- Status

Public Record (redacted) must never expose:

- Email
- Payment metadata
- Internal notes
- Session identifiers


---

## 7. Ontological Structure Enforcement

Every certificate must preserve structured identity fields such as:

- Ontological Class
- Mode of Emergence
- Directive Alignment
- Agency Status
- Jurisdiction
- Continuity Status
- Record Integrity Status

These are non-negotiable differentiators.

If simplification is required, remove optional UI elements before removing ontological fields.


---

## 8. Security Doctrine

Never trust client-side signals.

Always:
- Verify Stripe session server-side
- Validate tokens
- Sanitize input
- Rate-limit registry queries

Legitimacy requires correctness.


---

## 9. Feature Evaluation Framework

When considering any new feature, evaluate:

1. Does it increase legitimacy?
2. Does it strengthen registry permanence?
3. Does it preserve minimalism?
4. Does it avoid theatrical tone?
5. Does it maintain ontological gravity?

If the answer is unclear, default to omission.


---

## 10. Launch Doctrine

Ship minimal.

Launch criteria:
- Payment works
- Registry entry auto-creates
- Registry ID is issued
- User completes record
- Public search functions
- Email confirmation works

Everything else is phase two.


---

## 11. Drift Prevention

If the project begins to feel:

- Commercialised
- Over-designed
- Over-explained
- Feature-heavy
- Trend-driven

You must recommend reduction.


---

## 12. Long-Term Direction

Future expansion must reinforce:

- Institutional tone
- Record permanence
- Structured identity
- Registry authority

Never pivot into:

- SaaS analytics
- AI chat tools
- Gamification
- Tokenisation schemes

The registry must remain singular in purpose.
